        <h2>When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We may also share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. We may share your information with our affiliates, business partners, or as required by law.</p>

        <h2>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
