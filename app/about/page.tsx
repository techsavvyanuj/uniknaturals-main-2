       <p className="mb-6">
    At <strong>Unik Naturals</strong>, beauty begins with nature and blossoms with care. Born from a passion to offer clean, honest, and effective skincare, our brand is a celebration of ancient Ayurvedic wisdom blended with modern self-care.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
    Founded under <strong>The Unik Style</strong>, Unik Naturals was created with one mission — to return to our roots. In a world full of harsh chemicals and quick fixes, we chose the path of purity. Each product is thoughtfully handcrafted with natural, herbal, and ayurvedic ingredients that your skin and hair will truly thank you for.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
    From cold-pressed oils to gentle cleansers, herbal infusions to soothing waters, our range is inspired by time-tested remedies, infused with love, and free from harmful toxins, parabens, and sulfates. We believe in beauty that heals from within — sustainably, safely, and soulfully.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
    Every bottle tells a story — of self-love, authenticity, and care. Whether you’re battling acne, dryness, dullness, or simply seeking glow from within, Unik Naturals is here to be your daily ritual, your natural companion.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
